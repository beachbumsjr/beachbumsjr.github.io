  <h1> <center> A Summary Of Our Team</center> </h1>    
</div>

<center>
<p> The Beach Bums, Jr. is comprised of 6th, 7th and 8th graders from A.G.B.U. Manoogian School located in Southfield, Michigan.  Manoogian School is a school that promotes the development of the Armenian language, history, and art.  The 2019-2020 school  year, our first year in FIRST Robotics, celebrated the school’s 50th Anniversary.
<br> <br>
The 2021-2022 FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) marks our third year.  What is interesting is that it is like our first year.  Last season was a COVID year where we participated in Zoom meetings.  This year, we had to ‘relearn’ aspects of ourselves.
<br> <br>

As a team, we work great together.  Each of us has a favorite job to do, but we are always willing to pitch in whenever necessary.  We had many disagreements on how to proceed in the beginning but discovered that most plans worked best when we combined ideas.  We were fortunate to have some high school FRC students (previous FTC members) to mentor us.
<br> <br>

We were disappointed that some members of our team left for personal reasons.  While we did find replacement members, it took awhile to get them up to date. In the end, it all worked out.  We are also disappointed that we didn’t meet all of our goals; it’s obvious we like to dream large.  
<br> <br>

Covid certainly affected us this year.  School policy limited our volunteer and outreach programs; but we understand that it is important promote the health of everyone.  We hope to get back to these two areas as soon as the school will allow <br> <br>
us.

The Beach Bums, Jr. have developed the following skills:
	Budget Planning					 <br>

	Collaboration,					Planning<br>

	Communication					Problem Solving <br>
	Flexibility,						Respect,<br> 

	Gracious Professionalism,			Strategizing,<br> 

	Having Fun,						Team Building,<br> 

	Leadership Skills,					Time Management,<br>

	Math and Science Applications,			Organization

<h1> <center> OUTREACH </h1> </center>

<center>
<p> On December 3, we went to present to the entire 4th grade class. We explained what we do in robotics and the different parts of our team. We told them about the problem solution and the fundraising needed. We explained to them our problem of needed supplies. Then we explained that we will use drones. When we asked who was interested in joining the middle school team, we were surprised to see that many hands went up. The 4th graders said that they enjoyed learning about our team. </p>

<p>
	Showing our robot to the Manoogian School Board
<br>
At today’s outreach, we were invited to show off our robot 
to the ABGU Manoogian School’s School Board. We informed 
the school board about our team, and we showed them how the 
robot worked.  We talked about our engineering notebook and 
how we have to take notes every time we meet. 
<br>
<br>

It was set in the teacher’s lounge at our school so we didn’t have to go 	anywhere - easy and simple. 
<br>
<br>

	Some of the board members mentioned how they remember our robot from 	2019, and were impressed that some of us were on that team. 
<br>
<br>


	They were so proud of us!

 OUR NEW STEAM BUILDING
 </h1>
 </div>
<p>
A.G.B.U. Manoogian School houses three levels of schools: elementary, middle school, and high school.  While our building has been expanded and renovated a few times, we continually run out of space.  Creating our robotic team encroached on the limited space we had to store our materials; some of our stuff was stored in two of our teacher sponsor’s rooms, some in the high school lunch room, and others tucked away in the Middle School kitchen.
<br> 
<br> 
In 2019, Manoogian School received approval to proceed on building a new Steam Building.  This building will be available to high school, middle school, and elementary students.  We even hired a new director for the building.
<br> 
<br> 

In the summer of 2021, ground broke for the new building.  It is has been exciting to watch the building grow.  Space will be available for our three robotic teams:  Beam Bums, Beach Bums Junior, and the Beach Bum Minis.

<h1> FUNDRAISING </h1>

<h1>
Fundraising 1

</h1>
<p>

The Beach Bums, Junior team got their fundraising money from the Manoogian Munchies school store. This store is open on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays to all middle school students before school, at lunch, and after school. 
<br> <br>

The Manoogian Munchies store sells snacks for students to eat. There are many varieties of different snacks like granola bars, chips, cereal, crackers, and pop tarts. They also sell water, Arizona Tea, and Juice. Manoogian Munchies is open to different groups in the Middle School for fundraising. We had it for one month, and plan to do it again second semester.
<br> <br>

Many of the Beach Bums, Junior team members helped work at the school store. Some of us acted as the store cashier (collecting and counting the money) while others were clerks.
<br> <br>

In all, we collected around $100 dollars for our team.
<br> <br>

<h1>Fundraising 2 </h1>
<br> <br>
The Beach Bums, Junior team got their fundraising money from having a bake sale.  Team members brought in individualized goodies and drinks such as juice bags and pop.  We had to have everything individualized to keep everyone COVID safe.
<br> <br>

Tables were set up in the Middle School hallway and High Schooler even came to make purchases to support our team.
<br> <br>

We had so much food, we ended up having a second day – 50% off Day Old Bake Sale!
<br> <br>

The best part of having the bake sale was that it felt we were back to normal.  Our school has always enjoyed our bake sales.  Usually we have homemade treats, but even with store bought only, it was terrific!
<br> <br>

In all, we collected around $150 dollars for our team.
<br> <br>

We used this money to help pay for extra parts as well as other decorations we needed for the pit.

<h1> Fundraising 3 </h1>
<p>This year The Beach Bums, Junior team tried a new fundraising event by making Friendship Bracelets.  Is there any other way to reflect life on the beach than a friendship bracelet?
<br> <br>
Each bracelet was handmade by the team.  We even took special orders – such as adding beads to customize bracelets.
<br> <br>

The team earned around $75.  We used this money to help pay for extra parts as well as other decorations we needed for the pit.
